My idea was to build a bluetooth controlled RC car, and to do it as DIY as possible.
That is why the "chasis" or rather the base of the car is made from LEGO, and so is the axle and tires which i used.
For that reason the final functionality of the car itsef is, as can be seen in the videos, not as expected or really optimized.
Beacuse of the DIY nature of my build and the relatively weak torque the little DC motor produces, the car could only really move forwards and backwards when
the wheels were parallel and in line with each other.
Thats why even though i managed to accomplish steering via a servo motor attached to the front axle, the car could simply not move if the wheels were turned 
to a side.

As for fixing said issues, I had already spent a good bit of money on the parts and everything and I was satisfied with the things i learned along the way,
both about coding and about some simple electrical engineering.

After all, my whole goal was to make this RC car as DIY as possible.
Even the lego parts i used in it I got by dissassembling an old LEGO techno helicopter.
